# automated-multi-currency-invoicing
This project is an automated system designed to handle multi-currency invoicing and posting between two systems: a non-multi-currency BPO system and Sage Pastel, which supports multi-currency transactions. The system ensures that all invoices are correctly processed and posted with the appropriate currency conversion applied.
